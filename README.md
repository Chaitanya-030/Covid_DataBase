# Covid_DataBase
I gathered data on COVID-19 from Kaggle, and with the help of SQL queries, I explored the information to find useful insights. 
This analysis helped me understand how the pandemic has affected various aspects and provided valuable information about its spread and impact on different populations.

The analysis has not only provided statistical information but also empowered me to make data-driven decisions and contribute to ongoing efforts in combating the pandemic.
