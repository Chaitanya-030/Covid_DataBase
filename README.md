# Covid_DataBase
I have successfully created a comprehensive database using online datasets sourced from Kaggle, specifically focusing on COVID-19 deaths. 
I designed and executed a series of well-crafted queries to extract valuable insights and meaningful information from the dataset.

The amalgamation of these datasets and the proficiently written queries enable a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mortality rates and related trends.
